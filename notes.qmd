## Notes

Spatial data is any data that can be mapped spatially. Anything with a lat/long component.
 - can be point data
 - can be continuous data (temperature data across Australia).

Spatial data have geographic coordinates.
- The world is a sphere which has different coordinates than a 2D map
- Use projections to convert between 2D and 3D maps
- Project spatial data in a coordinate reference system (CRS)

Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Syntax
- need a projection to represnt data on a flat map
- Need an EPSG code - the CRS projection code
- 4326 (common one) WGS 84
- a different one that we will use in this presentation: PROJ4 strings

# Vector vs. Raster Data
- Vector: points, lines, polygons
    - better for categorical data
    - better storage options for a spatial layer characterized by many attributes.
- Raster: grids of cells, pixels
    - better for continuous data
    - better storage options for a spatial. layer characterized by one attribute.

# GIS tools
- tools that analyze and display geographically referenced data
- common ones: ArcGIS, QGIS, GoogleEarth Pro
- can also be done in R and Python
    - makes workflow reproducible when it's done in a programming language.


Question: Would cell size here be in the same units as the geometry? So metres for this example?
Answer: Yes. This is why the projection is also important because it takes the units thatâ€™s set in the CRS.


# Spatial Prioritization
Spatial prioritization - quantitative methods that aid in identifying priority areas for a particular action (e.g., conservation) while meeting certain criteria (e.g., meeting area-based targets)

Features: things that we care about with their
Targets: how much we want to include.
